# Trashnet_annotations

#The Trashnet repository with the original dataset can be found here: https://github.com/garythung/trashnet

#This repository includes two .zip arhive folders: one for cleaned dataset-resized and another for its annotations. The annotations can be used for trash object detection application

#The new cleaned dataset has 2521 images as a result of removing 6 images from the dataset-resized due to the difficulty in object recognition and annotation.

#The cleaned dataset and annotations have been split in train and test sets which are the standard sets for object detection. The test dataset is approximately 20% of the entire dataset.

#The cleaned dataset has been annotated using Pascal VOC standard for object detection.

#The annotation for Trashnet dataset have been made during the research available online:https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/20/7301. If you are using these annotations  for your work I would like to ask you to cite this paper
